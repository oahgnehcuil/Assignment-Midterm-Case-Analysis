# Sports Salary Statistics – MLB & NBA

## Introduction

This project includes two Python scripts, `mlb.py` and `nba.py`, which analyze player salary data from Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Basketball Association (NBA), respectively. These scripts leverage publicly available financial data from [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/) to compute key statistical metrics:  
- **Q1 (First Quartile)**  
- **Q3 (Third Quartile)**  
- **Median**  
- **Average**

These statistics provide insights into the salary distribution within each league.

Some portions of the scripts were generated or modified with the assistance of ChatGPT to ensure accurate processing and efficient data analysis.
